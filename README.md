# Walmart_Sales_Analysis
This project involved analyzing Walmart's sales data using SQL to uncover valuable insights into sales trends, consumer behavior, and operational performance. By leveraging the power of SQL operations, I analyzed an extensive dataset containing information about store operations, departments, weekly sales, and other factors influencing consumer behavior. The key objective was to identify major sales influencers and optimize strategies accordingly.

## Tools
- SQL
- Excel
  
## Key Findings
- Store Size and Sales: There was a direct relationship between store size and average weekly sales, suggesting larger stores tend to perform better.
- Seasonal Trends: Sales were higher during colder temperatures, indicating strong seasonal fluctuations in consumer spending.

## External Economic Factors:
- Fuel Prices and Consumer Price Index (CPI) had a noticeable impact on consumer behavior and sales.
- Surprisingly, unemployment rates did not show a significant correlation with sales, challenging typical assumptions.

## Department-level Insights: A detailed department-level analysis revealed specific areas for targeted sales strategies, enabling more focused and effective marketing.

## Outcome
The analysis provided actionable insights that can help Walmart and other businesses optimize sales strategies and make data-driven decisions. By identifying the key factors influencing sales, including store characteristics, seasonal fluctuations, and economic variables, the project demonstrated how to use SQL to uncover insights from complex datasets.
